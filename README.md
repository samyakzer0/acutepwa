## PhotoZApp

PhotoZApp is a decentralized application (dApp) for securely sending and receiving photos using blockchain technology. It leverages smart contracts to manage photo transfers, ensuring that only intended recipients can access the images. The application uses IPFS for decentralized storage of photos and Ethereum smart contracts for managing the transfer logic.

## Features

- **Secure Photo Transfer**: Send and receive photos using unique IPFS hashes.
- **Encryption Support**: Optionally encrypt photos before sending.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Ethereum to ensure transparency and security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use frontend for seamless interactions.

## Tech Stack

- **Web3.js**: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **IPFS**: For decentralized storage of photos.
- **Solidity**: Smart contracts for managing photo transfers.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.


## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)
- MetaMask wallet installed in your browser

## Install dependencies:

- npm install

P.S - Ensure you have deployed your smart contract on a suitable Ethereum test network (e.g., Sepolia).

~ Update the CONTRACT_ADDRESS in the code with your deployed contract address.


## Start the application:

~ npm start

~ Open your browser.
~ Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the dApp.
